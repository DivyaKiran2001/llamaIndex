**📦 What is StorageContext in LlamaIndex?**

**Definition:**
StorageContext is a central container in LlamaIndex that manages how your data, indexes, and embeddings are stored and retrieved.

**Purpose:**
Instead of rebuilding the index every time you restart your app, StorageContext lets you persist (save) your data and reload it later.
Think of it as the “glue” between your documents and your vector database / storage backend.
