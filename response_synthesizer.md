**ResponseSynthesizer**

Combines retrieved Nodes and generates a coherent response using an LLM.

**ðŸ”¹ What is get_response_synthesizer()?**

Itâ€™s a factory function in LlamaIndex that helps you create a ResponseSynthesizer object with the settings you want.

Think of it as a shortcut / helper:

Instead of manually configuring a ResponseSynthesizer,

You just call get_response_synthesizer() and pass in parameters like response_mode, llm, etc.

It returns a ready-to-use ResponseSynthesizer that you can plug into your retrieval pipeline.

**responsemode**

Determines how responses are synthesized (e.g., "tree_summarize", "compact").

**ðŸ”¹ Response Modes in LlamaIndex**

The response_mode parameter controls how the synthesizer builds the answer:

**compact (default and most common)**

All retrieved nodes are stuffed together in one prompt.

The LLM generates a single response from them.
âœ… Good for smallâ€“medium retrieved contexts.

**refine**

Processes nodes one at a time.

Starts with an initial response from the first node, then iteratively refines it with each subsequent node.
âœ… Useful when you have many nodes but want to keep the answer updated without overloading context.

**tree_summarize**

Builds a hierarchical summary.

Groups nodes into sub-summaries, then merges into a final answer.
âœ… Best for long documents or when summarizing large sets of chunks.

**simple**

Just concatenates the retrieved text and returns it, no real LLM synthesis.
âœ… Useful for debugging or when you want raw results.


**ðŸ”¹ What is RetrieverQueryEngine?**

Orchestrates retrieval and response synthesis, providing a unified interface for querying indexed data.

Itâ€™s a query pipeline component in LlamaIndex that ties together:

**Retriever** â†’ fetches relevant nodes/chunks from your index.

**ResponseSynthesizer** â†’ combines those nodes into a coherent answer using an LLM.

So, **RetrieverQueryEngine** = Retriever + ResponseSynthesizer in one query engine.

```python
retriever = VectorIndexRetriever(
    index=index,
    similarity_top_k=2,
)

response_synthesizer = get_response_synthesizer(
    response_mode="tree_summarize",
)

query_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine(
    retriever=retriever,
    response_synthesizer=response_synthesizer,
)

response = query_engine.query("Do i  have Ravi in the text file?")
print(f"Response: {response}")
```
