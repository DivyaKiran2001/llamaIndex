**📦 What is StorageContext in LlamaIndex?**

**Definition:**
StorageContext is a central container in LlamaIndex that manages how your data, indexes, and embeddings are stored and retrieved.

**Purpose:**
Instead of rebuilding the index every time you restart your app, StorageContext lets you persist (save) your data and reload it later.
Think of it as the “glue” between your documents and your vector database / storage backend.

**StorageContext allows you to:**

Persist the index (embeddings + doc metadata + index structure) into disk or external storage.

Reload it later without rebuilding embeddings.

**🔹 Persisting the Index : persist()** : When you create an index, you can save it:

Purpose: Save your index permanently (to disk or external storage).

**What it does:**

Saves embeddings, document metadata, and the index structure.

**Default location:** a folder called ./storage.

**Why:**

Without persisting, the index exists only in memory → lost after the program stops.

Persisting avoids recomputing embeddings when you restart.

**🔹 Loading a Saved Index : load_index_from_storage()**

**Purpose:** Reload a previously saved index (instead of rebuilding from scratch).

**What it does:**

Reads the data saved by persist().

Restores the embeddings + metadata + index structure.

**Why:**

Saves time (no re-embedding).

Saves cost (no repeated API calls to embedding models).

Enables long-term use in production apps.
